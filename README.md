# Worley Noise
This is a Worley Noise simulation using vanilla JavaScript and a canvas.  

It works by generating a fixed amount of points in random positions, then every pixel calculates it's distance
to every point and uses the shortest one to define his color, being whiter the closer it gets.

You can try it [here](https://s-chaves.github.io/Worley-Noise/).
